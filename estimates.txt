1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sla/,
I would say that minimum RTO is 60 seconds and it is fully handled by AWS RDS.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html promotion on the read-replica could take
several minutes and it seems that our current setup doesn't cover cross regional failover. So I assume the scenario when we set up
a human monitoring. In this case, I would say that it could take 40 minutes to detect the issue and initiate the remediation. And some extra
minutes to promote the read-replica to master. So in total I would say 45 minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

Since we have point in time (minutes) recovery I assume it to be less than a minute.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage

Since we have read-replica of the DB in another region I suppose that RPO for a single region outage to be equal to a single AZ outage which is less than a minute.
